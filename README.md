# Pirate-Themed 2D Top-Down Game

A 2D top-down pirate-themed game written in **C/C++** using **SDL2**.

This project was developed to practise core software development skills,
including game loops, input handling, rendering, basic collision detection,
enemy behaviour, and manual memory management. It also helped strengthen my
understanding of pointers, object lifetimes, and maintaining a larger codebase.

## Features
- Top-down player movement
- Keyboard and mouse input handling
- Basic collision detection
- Simple enemy movement and attack behaviour
- 2D rendering using SDL2
- Movement, attack, and visual effect animations
- Over 200 unique animations loaded dynamically
- Projectile system with tracking

---

## Technologies Used
- C
- C++
- SDL2
- SDL_image
- SDL_mixer
- ImGui

---

## Building and Running Requirements
- C++ compiler
- Windows platform

**Note:** All required dependencies and third-party libraries are included in the repository.

## What I Learned
- Implementing and managing a real-time game loop
- Handling keyboard and mouse input
- Working effectively with pointers
- Understanding object lifetimes and avoiding memory leaks
- Structuring and maintaining a larger C/C++ codebase
- Effectively using Visual Studio as a development environment
- Dynamically loading large quantities of assets
- Adding and linking external libraries
- Implementing basic collision detection

---

## Future Improvements
- Refactor code for improved readability and structure
- Add more documentation and in-code comments
- Improve enemy AI behaviour (potentially using A* pathfinding)
- Make the project easier to build (e.g. add a build system)
- Add friendly NPCs to enable group combat
- Introduce ships and ship battles
- Create a map editor using ImGui
